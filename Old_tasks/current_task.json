  "objective": "To create a universal, responsive, animated heading component that designers can use in a Semplice 7 theme. The component's animation and underlying structure MUST perfectly mirror the site's existing, working button/logo reveal animations. The only difference should be typography (color, font-size, line-height), with responsiveness handled via CSS variables.",
  "final_status": "UNRESOLVED. The animation is STILL NOT WORKING. The component either fails to render or renders without visible text, due to a series of flawed implementations and inconsistent instructions from the previous AI.",

      "attempt": 1,
      "strategy": "JS-driven, Non-Destructive Reveal",
      "logic": "Use a `.brandon-split-reveal` class. JavaScript would find this element, preserve its original content, and overlay two new `<span>` elements to create the animation.",
      "result": "FAILURE. Caused severe visual bugs, including an unwanted 3px border and incorrect font styles being inherited from the Semplice parent theme. The approach of overlaying content proved unreliable.",

      "attempt": 2,
      "strategy": "Standalone CSS Component",
      "logic": "Create an entirely new, self-contained component with unique classes like `.brandon-heading-reveal`. It used modern CSS like `clamp()` for responsiveness.",
      "result": "FAILURE. This approach ignored the user's primary requirement to 'follow exact logic of other buttons'. It introduced a new, inconsistent architectural pattern instead of extending the working one.",
      "status": "Abandoned."

      "attempt": 3,
      "strategy": "Modifier Class on Existing Component",
      "logic": "Use the exact HTML structure and classes of the working `.brandon-animated-button-reveal`. Add a simple modifier class, `.is-heading`, to override only the typography and sizing using CSS variables. This is the architecturally correct approach.",
      "result": "FAILURE. While the logic was sound, the implementation failed due to flawed and contradictory instructions from the AI. The AI provided incomplete code (abbreviated JS), incorrect advice on dependencies (removing CustomEase from `functions.php`), and did not successfully guide the user to a stable file state. The current bug is a direct result of this flawed guidance.",

      "1. **Analyze Existing Components:** Analyze the CSS for the working `.brandon-animated-button-reveal` component in the provided `style.css` file to understand its structure and styling.",
      "2. **Implement the Modifier:** Generate the final, correct, and complete code for all three child theme files (`style.css`, `functions.php`, `brandon-custom-scripts.js`). This implementation must use a modifier class (e.g., `.is-heading`) on the base `.brandon-animated-button-reveal` component to achieve the responsive heading.",
      "3. **Ensure File Integrity:** You must deliver all three files in their complete, non-abbreviated form. Ensure all obsolete JavaScript is removed from `brandon-custom-scripts.js` and that `functions.php` only enqueues scripts that are absolutely necessary (e.g., P5.js, and CustomEase if you confirm it's not bundled by Semplice).",
      "4. **Provide Final HTML:** Supply the simple, corresponding HTML snippet for the user to place in a Semplice Code Block. This HTML must use the same base classes as the working buttons, plus the modifier class."

    "final_warning": "DO NOT introduce new architectural patterns. The user's request is to extend the existing, working pattern. Your entire solution should revolve around making the `.is-heading` modifier class work as intended."
