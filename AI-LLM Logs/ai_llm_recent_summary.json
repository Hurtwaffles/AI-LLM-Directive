  "context": {
    "site_setup": {
      "platform": "WordPress",
      "theme": "Semplice 7 (with custom child theme)",
      "custom_backgrounds": "Animated P5.js canvas backgrounds injected via JS"
    },
    "reference_materials": [
      "brandon-main-background.html (custom background markup)",
      "Semplice-video--background.html (native Semplice background video markup)",

    "css_js_integration": {
      "layering": "Custom backgrounds are injected as absolutely-positioned divs (z-index: 0, pointer-events: none), preceding content in each <smp-section>. This matches Semplice's approach for video backgrounds.",
      "scoping": "CSS/JS is modular, using Brandon-namespaced classes. Only intended sections are targeted via unique classes (e.g. .brandon-bg-main-bg).",
      "best_practice": "No global or parent theme overrides; minimal, targeted injection and clean separation from core Semplice styles."
    }
  },
  "integration_findings": {
    "markup_structure": "Your injection pattern mirrors Semplice\u2019s: background container as the first child in each section, content wrappers above, using relative/absolute positioning and correct z-index.",
    "js_logic": "Custom JS scans for target sections, injects the background container if missing, ensures all necessary stacking context, and initializes P5.js sketch. Avoids double-injection and warns if section height is insufficient.",
    "css_validation": "All background layers are styled using Brandon namespace, compatible with Semplice. CSS avoids collision with core theme."

    "conclusion": "No significant browser jank, lockups, or animation stalls detected. The P5 background does add moderate CPU load (~26ms/sample), which may limit 60fps on lower-end hardware, but should be acceptable for a visually-driven portfolio."
  },
  "actionable_recommendations": [
    "For best results, keep P5.js backgrounds to one per page and optimize sketch code for efficiency (limit dot count, avoid unnecessary redraws).",
    "Monitor performance on a range of devices, especially laptops with integrated graphics.",
    "For detailed function-level bottleneck analysis, open the Firefox profile in https://profiler.firefox.com/ and inspect flame graphs.",
    "Use DevTools FPS meter for live animation feedback; target frame times under 16ms for true 60fps.",
    "If multiple backgrounds are required, stagger or reduce animation load per section."
  ],
  "validation_checklist": [
    "Confirm custom backgrounds are injected only on intended sections and do not interfere with content layout or interactions.",
    "Verify that section and content wrapper stacking/z-index remain correct after injection.",
    "Check that removing P5 backgrounds (in DevTools or code) reduces CPU to baseline.",
    "Test site in both Semplice Editor and published mode for parity."
